## 🔧 What is a “tool” (in AI)?

A **tool** is a **small helper** that does one job really well (like a calculator or weather app).
Your AI (the “brain”) can **ask** a tool to do that job and then use the result to answer you.

> **One‑liner:** *A tool is a helper your AI can use to get something done.*

## 🔧 What is “tool calling”?

**Tool calling** is when the AI **decides to use a tool** during a conversation.

**Flow:**

1. **User asks:** “What’s the weather in Karachi?”
2. **AI thinks:** “I need real weather data.”
3. **AI calls tool:** `get_weather(city="Karachi")`
4. **Tool returns:** `{"temp": 33, "condition": "Cloudy"}`
5. **AI answers:** “It’s 33°C and cloudy in Karachi.”

Think of it like a student using a **calculator** during an exam: the student decides *when* to use it, pushes the buttons (inputs), gets the number (output), and writes the final answer in their own words.

## 🧭 Why do we need tools?

* **LLMs don’t have live data.** Tools fetch today’s facts (weather, news, prices).
* **LLMs can’t act by themselves.** Tools *do things* (send email, book a slot, run code).
* **Accuracy & safety.** Tools can validate math, check a database, or enforce rules.

## 🧰 Common tool types (beginner names)

| Tool            | What it helps with       |
| --------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Search**      | Look up facts on the web |
| **Calculator**  | Do exact math            |
| **Weather**     | Get live weather         |
| **Email/SMS**   | Send a message           |
| **Code Runner** | Execute code safely      |
| **Database**    | Read/write app data      |

## 🧩 Real‑world analogy trio

* **Smartphone & apps:** Your phone (AI) decides when to open Maps (tool) to navigate.
* **Kitchen:** The chef (AI) uses a blender (tool) only when a recipe needs it.
* **Office:** The manager (AI) asks the finance system (tool) for an invoice total.

## 🌀 The life of a tool call (super simple)

1. **Intent detection:** “This needs outside help.”
2. **Pick a tool:** Choose the right helper.
3. **Fill inputs:** Provide clean, specific arguments (e.g., `city="Karachi"`).
4. **Run tool:** Call the function/API.
5. **Use result:** Explain it in normal language to the user.
6. **(Optional) Act again:** If needed, chain another tool (e.g., then send an email).

## 🧪 Tiny “paper” demo you can run in class (no code)

* Make three cards (tools): **Calculator**, **Weather**, **Dictionary**.
* Assign one student as **AI**, three students as **tools**, and one as **User**.
* User asks: “What’s 19×23 and is it hotter than 30°C in Karachi?”
* “AI” decides:

  * Calls **Calculator** → gets `437`.
  * Calls **Weather** → gets `33°C`.
* “AI” responds: “19×23 = 437. Yes, it’s hotter than 30°C (33°C).”
  This makes tool calling *visible* and fun.

## 🧑‍💻 What does a tool look like (conceptually)?

You define a **name**, **inputs**, and **what it returns** (output). For example:

```
Tool name: get_weather
Inputs: city (text)
Returns: { temp: number, condition: text }
```

The AI picks this tool when it sees a weather question and fills in `city` from the user’s message.

## ✅ When to use tools vs. not

* **Use tools** for live info, precise math, database reads/writes, sending messages, or doing real actions.
* **Don’t use tools** when a normal explanation, story, or concept answer is enough.

---

## 🛡️ Good habits for beginners who build tools

* **One job per tool** (single responsibility).
* **Clear names & inputs** (e.g., `send_email(to, subject, body)`).
* **Predictable outputs** (simple JSON).
* **Handle errors** (what if the city isn’t found?).
* **Stay safe** (never expose secrets; validate inputs).
