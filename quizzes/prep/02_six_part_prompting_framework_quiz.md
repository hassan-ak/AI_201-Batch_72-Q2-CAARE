### Suggested Next Drill
Take a weak AI response you received. Rebuild the original prompt explicitly using:
1. Command  
2. Context (Who / What / When)  
3. Logic (thinking steps / output structure)  
4. Roleplay (specific persona + tone)  
5. Formatting (table / list / sections)  
6. Questions (gap discovery)  

Then compare outputs side-by-side.
