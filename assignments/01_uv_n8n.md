# Assignment 01: UV Installation & Getting Started with n8n

## Objective

This assignment introduces two essential tools for modern development workflows:

* **UV Package Manager** â€“ a fast and modern Python package manager.
* **n8n** â€“ a workflow automation platform for connecting apps, APIs, and services.

By completing this assignment, you will gain hands-on experience in setting up UV, verifying your environment, and creating your first workflow in n8n.

## Problem Statement

You are tasked with preparing your local development environment by installing UV and setting up n8n. This will help you understand package management with UV and workflow automation with n8n, both of which are critical skills in building production-ready AI-powered systems.

## Why It's Exciting

* **UV Mastery:** Learn how to install and use one of the fastest modern package managers.
* **Automation with n8n:** Get started with a no-code/low-code workflow automation tool widely used in real-world projects.
* **Real-World Setup:** Combine environment preparation with automation skills youâ€™ll use in upcoming projects.

## Requirements

### Part 1: UV Installation

1. Install the **UV package manager** on your system by following the official installation guide.
2. Verify the installation by running:

   ```bash
   uv --version
   ```
3. After installation, take a **screenshot of your terminal** showing the UV version output.
4. Submit this screenshot as part of your assignment.

### Part 2: Getting Started with n8n

1. Install **n8n** on your machine using **Node.js (npm)**:

   ```bash
   npm install n8n -g
   ```
2. Start the n8n service by running:

   ```bash
   n8n
   ```

   Then open the n8n editor in your browser at [http://localhost:5678](http://localhost:5678).
3. Follow the official tutorial to create your **first workflow**:
