# Assignment 05 — Class 08 (2025-10-05): Build a Simple Chainlit Chatbot

## Objective

Create a minimal interactive chatbot using Chainlit that demonstrates a simple conversational loop and local context usage. The goal is to get hands-on experience with streaming chat responses, handling user state across turns, and embedding a small tool (a local utility function) the bot can call.

## Problem Statement

You will build and run a small Chainlit application that:

- Starts a web UI served locally using Chainlit.
- Accepts user messages and replies using a model (you may mock the model response if you don't have API access).
- Maintains simple session state (message history) and displays it in the UI.
- Exposes one small local tool (Python function) that the bot can call to, for example, reverse a string or fetch the current local time.

This assignment focuses on Chainlit wiring, local context handling, and a clear demonstration of results.

## Why It's Useful

- Learn how to wire a chat UI quickly with Chainlit.
- Practice maintaining session-local context across chat turns.
- See how to integrate small local tools as callable utilities from the agent.

## Requirements

1. Create a new directory for the assignment, for example `chainlit-chatbot/`.

## Why It's Useful

- Learn how to wire a chat UI quickly with Chainlit.
- Practice maintaining session-local context across chat turns.
- See how to integrate small local tools as callable utilities from the agent.

## Requirements

1. Create a new directory for the assignment, for example `chainlit-chatbot/`.
2. Implement a minimal Chainlit app that:
   - Serves a web UI locally (default Chainlit port is fine).
   - Accepts user input and responds with a generated reply.
   - Stores the conversation history in session state and displays it.
   - Implements a small local tool the bot can call (choose one):
     - reverse a string, or
     - return the current local time, or
     - compute the length of the provided text
3. The chatbot may use a real LLM (OpenAI or other) or a mocked response generator function if you don't have API keys. If you mock responses, make it clear in the README and keep the mock deterministic.
4. Provide a `README.md` inside the assignment folder with:
   - Short setup and run instructions.
   - How to switch between the real model and the mock.
   - Two screenshots: one showing the running Chainlit UI and one showing a sample conversation where the local tool is called successfully.
5. Add a `.env.example` (if using API keys) and ensure any real `.env` is ignored in `.gitignore`.

## Minimal Implementation Sketch

Below is a minimal sketch of what your main Python file might look like (adapt as needed):

```python
# app.py (sketch)
from chainlit import client, on_message
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

load_dotenv()

# Simple mock responder (replace with real LLM call when available)
def generate_reply(user_text: str) -> str:
    # Example: echo + simple tool trigger
    if user_text.startswith("/reverse "):
        return user_text.replace("/reverse ", "")[::-1]
    return f"Echo: {user_text}"

@on_message
async def handle_message(message):
    user_text = message.content
    reply = generate_reply(user_text)
    await client.send_message(reply)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Run Chainlit app using `chainlit run app.py` or similar
    pass
```

> Note: The sketch above is intentionally minimal. Use Chainlit docs for correct decorators and startup commands if APIs change.

## Submission

- Push the assignment folder (e.g., `chainlit-chatbot/`) to GitHub. Include `README.md`, `app.py` (or `main.py`), and `.env.example` if required.
- In the README include the two required screenshots:
  1. The Chainlit web UI opened in your browser.
  2. A conversation that demonstrates the local tool being called and returning the result.

## Deliverables Checklist

- [ ] Assignment folder `chainlit-chatbot/` with source files
- [ ] `README.md` with setup/run instructions and screenshots
- [ ] `app.py` (or `main.py`) implementing the bot
- [ ] `.env.example` (if using real model) and `.gitignore` excludes real `.env`
- [ ] Clear note if responses are mocked

## Grading Rubric

- App runs locally and serves Chainlit UI: 30%
- Conversation history is preserved and visible: 20%
- Local tool is implemented and callable from the bot: 20%
- Documentation and screenshots present: 20%
- Clean repo hygiene (`.env` ignored, no secrets): 10%

Total: 100%

## Tips & Troubleshooting

- Use `python -m venv .venv` and activate before installing dependencies, or use your preferred environment manager.
- Install Chainlit: `pip install chainlit` (or pin a version in `requirements.txt`).
- If the app does not start, check for port conflicts and ensure dependencies are installed.
- When using a real LLM, set API keys in `.env` and load them with `python-dotenv`.
