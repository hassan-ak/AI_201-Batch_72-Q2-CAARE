# Assignment 4 — “Hello, Agent” with OpenAI Agents SDK

Build two small Python apps using uv that each run a minimal “Hello, Agent” using the OpenAI Agents SDK.  Implement a simple agent that returns a short greeting generated by the model.

Important: Do not hardcode API keys. Use a .env file and ensure secrets are not committed to GitHub.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Practice uv workflows for both simple and packaged apps
- Install and use the OpenAI Agents SDK in a minimal app
- Load API keys securely from .env (never hardcode)
- Capture evidence via terminal screenshots and README docs
- Keep secrets out of source control with proper `.gitignore`

## ✅ Learning Outcomes

By the end, you’ll be able to:
- Initialize projects with `uv init` and `uv init --package`
- Configure and run a minimal agent using the OpenAI Agents SDK
- Load environment variables using `.env` (e.g., with `python-dotenv`)
- Add script entry points in `pyproject.toml` (for packaged app)
- Push a clean repo without leaking secrets

## 📦 What you will create

A parent directory containing two uv projects:

```
hello-agent-assignment/
├─ simple-agent/               # uv simple application
│  ├─ main.py                  # runs a minimal agent that prints a greeting
│  ├─ pyproject.toml
│  ├─ README.md                # must include terminal screenshot
│  ├─ .env.example             # contains GEMINI_API_KEY= (no real key)
│  └─ .venv/ (auto, do not commit)
└─ packaged-agent/             # uv packaged application (src layout)
   ├─ pyproject.toml
   ├─ README.md                # must include terminal screenshot
   ├─ .env.example             # contains GEMINI_API_KEY= (no real key)
   └─ src/
      └─ hello_agent/
         ├─ __init__.py
         └─ main.py            # exposes a run function (CLI entry point)
```

At repo root (parent of both projects), include a Python-focused `.gitignore` and make sure `.env` is ignored.

## 🧩 Minimal Agent Requirements

- Use the OpenAI Agents SDK to create a simple agent (e.g., name: `hello_agent`) with concise instructions.
- Prompt it with something like: `"Say hello in one short sentence."`
- Print the agent’s generated response to stdout (not hardcoded text).
- Load the API key from environment variables (via `.env`).
- Do not enable or require any external tools—keep it minimal.

Example sketch (for reference only; adapt as needed):

```python
# main.py (simple-agent)
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from agents import Agent, Runner

# Load variables from .env (GEMINI_API_KEY must be set in .env)
load_dotenv()

agent = Agent(
    name="hello_agent",
    instructions="You are a concise assistant that greets the user in a single short sentence."
)

result = Runner.run_sync(agent, "Say hello in one short sentence.")
print(result.final_output)
```

For the packaged app, expose a callable in `src/hello_agent/main.py` (e.g., `def run(): ...`) and add a script entry under `[project.scripts]` in `pyproject.toml` so you can run it like `uv run hello-agent`.

## 🔐 Secrets: .env and Git Hygiene (Required)

- Create a `.env` file in each project with:
  
  ```
  GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
  ```
  
- Create `.env.example` (no real key) and commit only the example file.
- Add the real `.env` to `.gitignore` (at root and/or per-project). Do not commit secrets.
- In code, use `python-dotenv` to load the `.env` file (or configure your editor/terminal to load env vars).
- Before pushing, verify you did not commit secrets:

## 📤 Submission

- Push your assignment to GitHub as a single repository containing both projects under one parent directory.
- Each project must include its own `README.md` with a terminal screenshot of the agent’s output.
- Submit the GitHub repository link.

## ✅ Deliverables Checklist

- Parent directory with two projects: `simple-agent/` and `packaged-agent/`
- Both apps implement a minimal “Hello, Agent” using the OpenAI Agents SDK
- Output is generated by the model (not hardcoded)
- `.env.example` exists (no real key) and real `.env` is ignored
- `README.md` in each project includes a terminal screenshot of the output
- Root-level `.gitignore` suitable for Python projects and includes `.env`
- GitHub link submitted
- Verified no API keys or secrets are committed before pushing

## 🧪 Acceptance Criteria (Grading Rubric)

- Project structure (simple + packaged, uv usage): 20%
- Minimal agent runs and prints model-generated greeting: 25%
- Secure secrets handling (.env usage, no keys in code/repo): 25%
- Documentation: README + screenshot for each app: 20%
- Clean repo hygiene: `.gitignore`, no venv/build artifacts committed: 5%
- Commit history clarity (meaningful messages): 5%

Total: 100%

## 💡 Tips & Troubleshooting

- After editing `pyproject.toml`, run `uv sync` if dependencies or scripts changed.
- Use `uv run <command>` to execute within the project environment without activating the venv.
- If `ModuleNotFoundError` occurs, confirm dependencies (e.g., `openai-agents`, `python-dotenv`) are in `pyproject.toml` and synced.
- For packaged app, run via script entry (e.g., `uv run hello-agent`) or module (e.g., `uv run -m hello_agent.main`).
- Never paste real API keys into code or README screenshots.
