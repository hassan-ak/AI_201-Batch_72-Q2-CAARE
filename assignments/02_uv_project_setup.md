# Assignment 02 â€” UV Project Setup: Simple & Packaged Applications

Build two small Python apps using uv: one Simple Application and one Packaged Application. Both apps must implement any functionality you choose and print your Name and PIAIC Registration Number every time they run. Submit a GitHub link with screenshots in each appâ€™s README.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Practice uv workflows for both simple and packaged apps
- Understand src layout, scripts, and running via `uv run`
- Capture evidence via terminal screenshots and README docs
- Push a clean, Python-ready repo with proper `.gitignore`

## âœ… Learning Outcomes

By the end, youâ€™ll be able to:
- Initialize projects with `uv init` and `uv init --package`
- Structure code for simple vs. packaged apps
- Define and run CLI script entries in `pyproject.toml`
- Reproduce environments with `uv sync` and run code with `uv run`

## ðŸ“¦ What you will create

A parent directory containing two uv projects:

```
uv-assignment/
â”œâ”€ simple-app/              # uv simple application
â”‚  â”œâ”€ main.py
â”‚  â”œâ”€ pyproject.toml
â”‚  â”œâ”€ README.md             # must include terminal screenshot
â”‚  â””â”€ .venv/ (auto, do not commit)
â””â”€ packaged-app/            # uv packaged application (src layout)
   â”œâ”€ pyproject.toml
   â”œâ”€ README.md             # must include terminal screenshot
   â””â”€ src/
      â””â”€ my_packaged_app/
         â”œâ”€ __init__.py
         â””â”€ main.py
```

At repo root (parent of both projects), include a Python-focused `.gitignore` to keep the repo clean.

## ðŸ“¤ Submission

- Push your assignment to GitHub as a single repository containing both projects under one parent directory.
- Each project must include its own `README.md` with a terminal screenshot of the output.
- Submit the GitHub repository link.

## âœ… Deliverables Checklist

- Parent directory with two projects: `simple-app/` and `packaged-app/`
- Simple app prints your Name and PIAIC Reg# and implements some functionality
- Packaged app prints your Name and PIAIC Reg# and implements some functionality
- `README.md` in each project includes a terminal screenshot of the output
- Root-level `.gitignore` suitable for Python projects
- GitHub link submitted

## ðŸ§ª Acceptance Criteria (Grading Rubric)

- Project structure (simple + packaged, uv usage): 20%
- Functionality present in both apps: 20%
- Required prints (Name + PIAIC Reg#) in both apps: 20%
- Documentation: readme + screenshot for each app: 25%
- Clean repo hygiene: `.gitignore`, no venv/build artifacts committed: 10%
- Commit history clarity (meaningful messages): 5%

Total: 100%

## ðŸ’¡ Tips & Troubleshooting

- After editing `pyproject.toml`, run `uv sync` if dependencies or scripts changed.
- Use `uv run <command>` to execute within the project environment without activating the venv.
- If module imports fail when running by path, switch to script (`uv run packaged-app`) or module form (`uv run -m my_packaged_app.main`).
- Pin interpreter if required for your environment: `uv python pin 3.12`.
